# code
Code snippets, examples and ready-to-use classes and modules.

We publish here parts of code which can be include as-is or with some adaptation to real projects. Some of the publication here are whole example projects that show the usage of something - a standard function, or something that we made in RnD. When needed there will be instructions how the code to be embedded in projects.

Some of examples are not static, the may have future versions. So they will have its own branches and tags.
